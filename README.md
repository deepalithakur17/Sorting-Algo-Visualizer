# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides an interactive and dynamic way to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It showcases the step-by-step process of sorting an array, with bars representing array elements that change positions in real-time as the algorithm progresses.
